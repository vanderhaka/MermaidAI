## Notes

- jsdom ESM compat issue: use `// @vitest-environment node` for non-DOM test files
- Component tests use `// @vitest-environment happy-dom` — jsdom 29 has ESM top-level await incompatibility with Node 24
- Placeholder Database types cause tsc `never` errors on `.insert()`/`.update()` — resolved when `supabase gen types` runs against real schema
- Some wave 3 code landed in neighboring agent commits due to concurrent staging; attribution commits added
- Build blocked by placeholder Database type errors (same root cause as tsc errors)
